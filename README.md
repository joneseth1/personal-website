# portfolio-website
My portfolio website was created using ReactJS. I used normal CSS and HTML along with React and React-Three-Fiber which added some nice flair (I think). I really enjoyed
coding up the React section of all of this and by no means am I a web designer but I thought the design came out looking pretty cool! I loved the color scheme I chose. 
I'm looking forward to maybe adding some more things to this website down the line.
